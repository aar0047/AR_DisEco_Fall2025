Quarto is a powerful tool for creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and data visualizations. For your assignments and worksheets, using Quarto will allow you to seamlessly integrate your analysis with your written explanations/comments, making your reports more cohesive and professional.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Integrating Code and Text

Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    -   59

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    a\. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population.

    b\. 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population.

    -   When comparing the different prevalence of large populations, the 1% prevalence sample size requirement is going to be double that of the 2% prevalence. This becomes much more accurate when the population size is 2500 or larger, however there is still a large gap between smaller population sizes when comparing those prevalence values.
    -   When looking at an Infinite population with 1% prevalence, the sample size requirement would be 299, while the sample size for 2% prevalence in an infinite population would be 149.

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is:

    -   \<1%
    -
