## Worksheet 2 09/22/2025

![](images/ss_table.png)

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    -   59

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    a\. 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population.

    b\. 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population.

    -   When comparing the different prevalence of large populations, the 1% prevalence sample size requirement is going to be double that of the 2% prevalence. This becomes much more accurate when the population size is 2500 or larger, however there is still a large gap between smaller population sizes when comparing those prevalence values.
    -   When looking at an Infinite population with 1% prevalence, the sample size requirement would be 299, while the sample size for 2% prevalence in an infinite population would be 149.

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is:

    -   \<1%

## Worksheet 3 10/07/2025

1.  Jan's research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjuctivitis started on 10th june 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

    RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/2025.

![](images/clipboard-790930184.png)

show your work.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

-   6/12/25 : 5 new infected/ 51 still susceptible = 0.098 new cases per elk-day

-   6/14/25 : 2 new infected/ 44 still susceptible = 0.045 new cases per elk-day

-   6/15/25 : 0 new infected/ 42 still susceptible = 0 new cases per elk-day

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

-   6/13/25 : 12 infected/ 56 total pop = 0.214 or 21.4% prevalence of conjunctivitis

-   6/16/25 : 5 infected/ 56 total pop = 0.089 8.9% prevalence of conjunctivitis

c\) on which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

-   6/11/25. There is one brand new case of infection in the population, meaning this is a new case (incidence) as well as the only case (prevalence)

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest?

-   06/10/25 the incidence is the lowest at 0.07 new cases per elk-day

## Midterm Exam 10/07/2025

FORY 7200

Disease Ecology Midterm

1.  True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect

a\. Compared to macroparasites, microparasites have a shorter generation time and do not reproduce within the host.

False. Although microparasites have a short generation time and macroparasites have a long generation time, macroparasites have a high rate of reproduction within the host, making this statement incorrect.

b\. Using disease models, we can make accurate predictions of how a disease will spread in a real-world host population.

False. Real world systems are quite complex. Although disease models are a great tool to understand diseases and the spread, it is not useful in trying to make accurate predictions because in the real world there are many other factors that must be included.

c\. Chagas disease is a protozoal disease that is commonly transmitted by the triatomine bug (Kissing bug). It can also be transmitted by consumption of contaminated food or beverages (feces of infected triatomine bugs). Chagas disease is therefore a contagious disease.

False. In order to be contagious, a disease must be able to be transmitted person to person. Chagas disease is a vector-borne disease, meaning its mode of transmission is from bug to person. It is also able to be transmitted via food, however the food must have been contaminated by the bug for it to transmit that way.

Source: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)

d\. Epizootic Hemorrhagic disease always causes severe outbreaks in white-trailed deer populations across the US, resulting in high mortality.

False. The more North you go in America, there are less outbreaks of the Epizootic Hemorrhagic disease. This concludes that EDH does not always cause severe outbreaks across the US.

e\. White-tailed deer infected with brain worm (*Parelophostrongylus tenuis*) rarely exhibit any symptoms or clinical signs. But infected white-tailed deer pass infectious larvae through their feces. White-tailed deer with brain worms can therefore be described as infected, diseased and infectious.

False. In this case, these deer are infected and infectious but are not diseased since they rarely exhibit symptoms or signs.

f\. The deer mouse (*Peromyscus maniculatus*) infected with Sin Nombre Virus do not show any clinical signs, but excrete the virus in their urine, feces and saliva. Humans get infected via aerosolized droppings of an infected rodent. The illness caused by Sin Nombre virus in humans is called Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS). HPS is therefore a vector-transmitted disease.

False. There is no vector in this situation. HPS is transmitted directly from animal to human, which means this is an animal-borne disease.

2.  Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease: Prevalence and incidence.

Both prevalence and incidence measure the frequency of occurrence for a disease, infection, exposure, etc. However, prevalence is the number affected in proportion to total population at a point in time, while incidence is a measure of the risk of infection by only considering new cases only. Incidence uses the number of new cases of disease is a specific time divided by the number of animals at risk developing a disease.

3.  Match the following

    |                                   |                                      |
    |-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    | a\. Infection                     | 1\. Blackhead disease                |
    | b\. Signs of illness              | 2\. A pathogen invading host tissues |
    | c\. Brain worm infection in moose | 3\. Brain worm in white-tailed deer  |
    | d\. Disease caused by virus       | 4\. 𝛽                                |
    | e\. Disease caused by protezoa    | 5\. Rabbit Hemorrhagic disease       |
    | f\. Effective contact rate        | 6\. White-nose syndome               |
    |                                   | 7\. Disease                          |

    (a,2), (b,7), (c,3), (d,5), (e,1), (f,4)

4.  Moose can get infected by consuming a gastropod infected with *Parelaphostrongylus tenuis* larvae. Infected moose exhibit clinical signs like weakness, incoordination, circling, paralysis, and eventual death. But moose are unable to propagate the parasite. Such hosts are called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

    Dead end hosts.

5.  

a\) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Measles. Average infectious period for measles is 8 days

γ =1/D=1/8

=0.125/day

b) Calculate the average recovery rate (γ) for Rotavirus. Average infectious period for Rotavirus is1-3 weeks, average of 2 weeks.

γ =1/D=1/14

= 0.0714/day

c\) The R~0~ for measles is estimated at 15 and 17 for rotavirus. Calculate β for both diseases.

R~0~ = β/𝛾, so β= R~0~ \* 𝛾

β~measles~= R~0~ \* 𝛾

𝛾~measles~ = 0.125/day <https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/common-questions-about-measles>

-   So β~measles~=1.875

β~rotavirus~= R~0~ \* 𝛾

𝛾~rotavirus~ = 0.111/day <https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8275-rotavirus>

-   So β~rotavirus~= 1.89

d\) Calculate R~eff~for a measles outbreak in a population with 80% measles vaccination coverage.

R~eff~= R0 x S

=3

6.  6\. For any transmissible disease, which of the following host states are possible?

    1.  Infected but not diseased

        -   This state is possible. For example, white-tailed deer act as a reservoir for *Parelaphostronglyus tenuis* because they carry the larvae without exhibiting any symptoms of disease.

    <!-- -->

    2.  Infected and diseased
        -   This state is possible. For example, moose infected with *Parelaphostronglyus tenuis* larvae often show weakness and neurological signs of disease due to infection.
    3.  Not infected but diseased - This state is not possible. This is not possible because to be diseased you must first become infected. Without infection by a transmissible pathogen, disease cannot occur because disease is mainly the symptoms and distress exhibited due to infection.

    For each state, explain your reasoning and support your answer with at least one example from human or wildlife disease systems. If you believe a particular state is *not possible*, justify why with clear reasoning.

7.  Estimate the incubation period for Campylobacteriosis and Norovirus gastroenteritis from the following Epidemic curves.

![](images/clipboard-2364840772.png){width="352"}

![](images/clipboard-3048589059.png){width="288"}

Campylobacteriosis: around 2-5 Days

Norovirus: around 1-2 Days

8\. In 2015, a mass die-off of Saiga antelope occurred in Kazakhstan, resulting in the deaths of over 200,000 animals within a short period. Briefly describe the proximate cause of this extraordinary mortality event and explain how it led to such large-scale deaths. What measures could be implemented to prevent similar mortality events in the future? Finally, discuss broader conservation strategies that could help safeguard Saiga antelopes from extinction due to disease outbreaks.

The cause of this mass mortality event in Saiga was caused by a bacteria called *Pasteurella multocida* that is usually commensal in Saiga. By being commensal, the bacteria and Saiga lived with a symbiotic relationship, where the Saiga were neither benefited or hurt, and the bacteria was benefiting. However due to a rapid change in the environment the bacteria became virulent and led to acute hemorrhagic septicemia in a mass casualty event of the population.

At this time, there were large herds of Saiga due to herd calving, which means not only did this disease flip on almost immediately, but it was also able to be transmitted quite easily because the population of this herd was near each other. Along with the close proximity of the calving Saiga, since they were calving this means the adult Saiga were already weaker and more susceptible to disease making it easier to infect.

To prevent future mortality events, wildlife conservationists could implement vaccine programs, also they could interfere with large scale herding during calving to prevent transmission if this were to occur again, however there are no true models as to how prevention for this mass mortality event because all alleys of prevention are unrealistic or impossible.

The best course of action in this instance is to provide protected reserves for the Saiga population if this were to occur, so they can bounce back without factors such as predators or poachers. Saiga’s rapid birth rate is how they were able to bounce back in previous mass mortality events, and by adding extra preservation to their environment could help them bounce back even faster.

9\. In his 1933 book *Game Management*, Aldo Leopold dedicated a chapter to wildlife diseases, stating that wildlife disease is primarily an ecological issue driven largely by human actions. Do you agree with this perspective? Explain your reasoning, using at least two examples from wildlife disease systems to support your answer.

Yes, I do agree with the stance that wildlife diseases are largely driven by human interactions. For example, white nose syndrome in bats is largely due to fungal dispersion through caving and mining performed by humans in the US. Since humans brought this fungal disease to the US from Europe, it is a key indicator that humans directly affect wildlife diseases, especially in this case since some species of bats are now listed as endangered. Another example of direct human impact on wildlife disease is human interference with wildlife terrain. If humans deforest areas or take over part of an animals natural habitat, then those wild animals are susceptible to more infection due to the closer proximity and availability for transmission. Similarly, the overseas transport of animals can directly affect disease transmission, possibly introducing new diseases to new areas, like the Colombian Exchange. This is especially bad because of the potential threat new diseases can cause to wildlife, plants, and even humans. So, yes humans do have a direct negative effect on the disease ecology of wild animals and species.

10\. Define R~0~. Estimate R~0~ for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents an infectious case, and blue are susceptibles; an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world utility of R~0~.

R~0~ : The basic reproduction number. The average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population.

Based on the findings below, the average R~0~ is 1.5. Since the average R~0~ \>1, this has the potential to spread farther, and cause an outbreak amongst this population for this disease.

11. Steve studies a population of the Suwannee Alligator Snapping turtle (*Macrochelys suwanniensis*) in Florida. He has been conducting a mark-recapture study of this population since 2010.  Since 2015, he has documented cases of cutaneous fibroma in this population. The following data was collected by Steve:

    | Year | Population Estimate | Turtles with fibroma: old cases | Turtles withfibroma: new cases |
    |------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
    | 2015 | 133 | 0 | 4 |
    | 2016 | 125 | 2 | 5 |
    | 2017 | 112 | 4 | 8 |
    | 2018 | 145 | 5 | 4 |
    | 2019 | 136 | 4 | 2 |

Turtles without visible fibroma are considered susceptible to the disease.

a\) Which year has the highest incidence of turtle fibroma? Make sure you write appropriate unit for the incidence value. Show your work.

2017\.

112 pop – 4 old cases = 108 susceptible in the population

8 new cases of infection/108 susceptible hosts = 0.074 cases per turtle-day

b\) When is the prevalence lowest? When is the prevalence highest? Write unit for prevalence if applicable.

Prevalence is lowest in 2015.

-   4 infected/133 population = 0.03 or 3% prevalence

Prevalence is highest in 2017.

-   12 infected/112 population = 0.107 or 10.7% prevalence

12. The Dutch harbor seal population is estimated to be around 5400 with \~50% adults. Seals are susceptible to phocine distemper virus (PDV), but an estimated 40% of the adults in this population are immune to PDV by virtue of prior natural infection. How many seals in this population should be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity sufficient to prevent an outbreak of PDV in this population if the R0 is estimated to be \~3? Assume that all the adult seals that have survived prior PDV infection are tagged, and hence identifiable.

    Adult pop: 5400/2 = 2700

    Adult pop naturally immune: (2700 adult pop) x (0.4 naturally immune) = 1080

    Adult pop susceptible: 2700 - 1080 = 1620

    R~0~ : 3

    1/R0 : 0.33

    1080 susceptible/5400 total pop : 0.2

    Herd Immunity threshold: 1- 1/R0 : 0.67

    67% of the total population must be immune to prevent outbreak. Since 20% of the population is already naturally immune, then 47% of the susceptible population must be vaccinated to prevent outbreak and achieve herd immunity.

## Worksheet 4 10/23/2025

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care-associated outbreaks. Humans MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April 2012 - September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

![Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? (*if incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is correct.)*](images/clipboard-3968567455.png)

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.
    -   Incorrect. MERS-CoV is not primarily maintained in human populations. Human-to-human transmission rates are low because MERS-CoV is mainly transmitted from camel to camel, and if MERS-CoV is transmitted to a human host it is not sustained in the population. Direct human contact with a camel can lead to transmission originating from spillover.
2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV.
    -   Correct.
3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV.
    -   Incorrect. In this case human-to-human transmission is very limited and when this virus is transmitted it is not sustained in the human population, however since there is still transmission between humans we cannot say humans are a dead-end host, rather they are the transient hosts.
4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.
    -   Incorrect. Approximately 35% of reported cases were fatal.
5.  The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak.
    -   Incorrect. The epidemic curve shows sporadic outbreaks or repeated waves and not a single point of exposure, which would have been the point source outbreak. This is mainly due to the fact that camel-to-human transmission is due to spillover events, and human-to-human transmission is limited and not sustained.
6.  Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019. Why do you think this decline occurred? Discuss possible ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors that may have contributed to this trend.
    -   MERS cases have shown a rapid decline since 2019, which suggests there have been a decline in human and camel interactions that follow that timeline. This could be due to the Covid 19 pandemic that really took hold beginning in 2019 and running rampant in 2020 which caused a pause on any travel, international or domestic, as well as quarantining kept everyone away from each other which could have stopped that human-to-human transmission.

    -   The transmission of the disease in humans was much more prevalent in hospital settings, so with the increased PPE implemented for Covid 19, this could prevent transmission as well.

    -   It has also been reported that there is an increase of surveillance on this disease and its transmission, and protocols have been developed for cases that do arise to ensure the transmission is kept to a minimum through following these protocols.

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units.

1.  Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

    -   By using the community epidemiology framework, I consider the Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda a spillover event. A spillover event is when a pathogen's resevoir host is an animal, and close contact with humans will cause the transmission, but continued transmission from human to human is not well sustained, and the humans in this situation are most likely dead-end or transient hosts. Also, the human to human transmission was contained to healthcare workers in the ICU, with only 66 cases being documented.

2.  What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

    -   Limiting human contact with the known reservoir host, Egyptian rousette bats, can limit any new spillover events for this virus, because if there are no new spillover events then the pathogen cannot be transmitted human to human, and the original spillover event will eventually stop because it is not able to be sustained in human to human transmission. This can be done by blocking off habitats of the bats, limiting cave exploration and mining, and making the public aware of the high risks they would be putting themselves at if they were to come into contact with one of these bats. Along with informing the public, early signs and symptoms can be shared, and infection can be mapped and monitored to quarantine the infected, especially alerting healthcare professionals to take extra measures to ensure their health and safety.

## Worksheet 6 11/10/2025

A new disease, *Vertico,* has been detected in fish in two separate ponds. Your task is to analyze the sample data to determine and compare the disease prevalence between the two ponds.

**Instructions:**

1.  Determine Prevalence

    a\. Use the online tool QPweb to calculate the prevalence of Vertico in each pond.

    b\. Report the prevalence as a percentage

2.  Calculate the 95% confidence Interval

    a\. Use QPweb to calculate the 95% CI for each prevalence estimate.

    b\. Report the CI values as percentages, rounded meaningfully.

3.  Compare the prevalence between the two ponds.

    a\. Perform a Fishers exact test to compare the two prevalence values.

    b\. Report the p-value

    c\. state whether the difference is statistically significant. (p\<0.05, the difference is statistically significant)

**Deliverables:**

For each pond, report the following:

-   Prevalence (%)

    -   Pond1: 30%

    -   Pond2 6.7%

-   95% Cl (%)

    -   Pond1: Lower: 14%, Upper: 53%

    -   Pond2: Lower: 0.3%, Upper: 30%

-   Fisher's exact test p-value

    -   Two-sided p-value: 0.1987

-   Interpretation ( Is the difference statistically significant?)

    -   This is not statistically significant. The p-value obtained is larger than 0.05, which is the p-value threshold for being either statistically significant, or by chance.

## Worksheet 7 11/16/2025

**Nipah Virus**

Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting.

-   The Nipah virus was originally thought to be transmitted animal to animal to human from close contact with infected animals. However, we now understand there are six different transmission pathways that we can see Nipah virus transmit through. In Malaysia we historically saw animal to animal to human transmission, while in Bangladesh we mainly saw transmission via bats getting into pots of date palm sap and defecating/eating the sap, effectively transmitting the virus that way when humans would consume the sap. So, we have animal to human transmission due to close contact, and then animal to human transmission due to ingestion of waste from the animal. These different modes of transmission will influence different preventitive measures because in Malaysia, we should be taking more precautions when coming in close contact to both bats (the original host) as well as pigs, which pigs are where the main human transmission came from. while in Bangladesh, we should be more cautious in date palm sap collection methods, ensuring bats cannot get into the baskets that collect the sap or be able to defecate into the basket.

**Avian Reovirus**

Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population.

-   According to the presentation, there are two main routes of transmission for Avian Reovirus: Horizontal fecal-oral, and vertical egg transmission. The fecal-oral route is mainly transmitted between birds through the ingestion of feces, while the egg transmission route is passed from hens directly to their chicks. Environmental factors that favor the disease include humid, cooler climates, in pens that are overcrowded and unhygienic, which will increase the rate of fecal-oral transmission in overcrowded pens with poor hygiene conditions. A major contributor to the transmission route of ARV is its ability to persist in many environmental factors, which other viruses might become much more succeptable to environmental degredation. Finally, an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV can be winter mortality of crows. This is due to large numbers of crows becoming infected and dying while they roost during the winter. This is especially important because it describes a time in the wild where birds are going to be in close proximity to eachother without being in captivity because they are coming together in the winter to roost. This promotes the spread of winter mortality caused by ARV. This can affect hundreds of crows in the roost each winter.

**Langya henipavirus**

Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID?

-   The bird shrew is going to be the likely reservoir of LayV, and the transmission route is likely a spillover event to humans due to close contact with infected shrews, as well as close contact with bodily fluids. LayV is classified as a spillover event and not an EID because of the data that persists. There is very low prevalence at the population level, with 35 human cases reported, and there are no cases reported outside of China. These infections are sporadic and localized, which correlates more with a sporadic zoonotic infection, not an EID. This is backed up by the fact that there is no real sustained human to human transmission, meaning this disease cannot establish itself within the human population, and cases of human infection will continue to be confined to close direct or indirect contact with shrews or their bodily fluids.

## Worksheet 8 11/19/2025

For raccoon roundworm, 106 raccoon were examined for a better understanding of this disease. Of 106 examined, 50 raccoons were infected, meaning:

prevalence: 47.2%.

Lower CI: 37.4%

Upper CI: 57.1%

These raccoon were examined from three regions, North South and Central. The prevalence from each are as follows:

#### Prevalence (Region): 

-   North: 28.6%

-   South: 62.8%

-   Central: 64.3%

#### 95% CI:

North:

-   Lower: 16.6%, Upper: 43.3%

South:

-   Lower: 46.7%, Upper : 77%

Central:

-   Lower: 35.1%, Upper: 87.2%

These prevalence rates and confidence intervals indicate the north region to have a much lower prevalence than the south and central regions, which have higher prevalence of over half.

#### Prevalence (Sex)

-   Male : 37.7%

-   Female: 64.9%

#### 95% CI:

Male:

-   Lower: 26.3%, Upper: 50.2%

Female:

-   Lower: 47.5%, Upper: 79.8%

which indicates female racoons are much more likely to become infected than male raccoons.

#### Prevalence (Age):

-   Adult: 52.2%

-   young adult: 37.8%

#### 95% CI:

Adult:

-   Lower: 39.8%, Upper: 64.4%

Young Adult:

-   Lower: 22.5%, Upper: 55.2%

which indicates a slightly more prevalent prevalence in adult raccoons than young adult raccoons.

Overall, we can see a high significance in central and southern regions possibly due to raccoon populations in these regions versus the north, as well as a warmer climate that may increase bacterial growth in these regions to persist this dusease. We also see significant sex differences between male and female raccoons, with females having a much higher prevalence of infection, however what we do not really see much significance in is age differences between adults and young adults.
